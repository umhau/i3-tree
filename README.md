# i3-tree
Hacked-together tree-style tabs in i3. 

Define which monitors get a tree. (all?)

- Reserve space on the side of the specified monitors. (gaps left 128)

- put a floating window in the reserved space.
- contents of the window: displays a tree of i3-windows, 
    - based on https://github.com/altdesktop/i3ipc-python. Also other stuff, customizable.
    - Or https://github.com/altdesktop/i3ipc-glib

- Windows should become children, not peers, of the window that's active when the new one is created. Manage this with a modification of: https://github.com/olemartinorg/i3-alternating-layout. 

- (This needs some work. Can Linux detect how windows are created?) There should be a difference between genuinely new windows, created manually, and windows generated by a command inside an existing window.
